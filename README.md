An image labeling tool designed for annotating images with bounding boxes.
It supports both manual and automatic labeling modes. Users can draw rectangles around objects
in the images and assign class labels to them. The tool saves the annotations in both XML and YOLO
formats. It also allows users to load existing annotations, adjust the threshold for automatic
labeling, and generate YOLO files from XML annotations in a selected folder.
